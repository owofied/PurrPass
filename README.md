## Why reinvent the wheel?

You may be wondering why PurrPass exists when other password managers are available. PurrPass was created to provide:

**1. Self-hosting control:** You have complete control over your data security and privacy by self-hosting.

**2. Open Source Transparency:** The source code is open for review, building trust and allowing community contributions.

**3. User-Centered Design:** PurrPass user-friendly interface is designed for ease of use.

**4. Password Security:** Strong encryption ensures that your data remains secure.

**5. Data Backup and Accessibility:** Backup and synchronization options keep your data safe and accessible.
